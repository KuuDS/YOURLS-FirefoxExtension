# YOURLS Firefox extension

> **This version of the YOURLS Firefox extension is using legacy techniques, which are not anymore supported by Firefox!** Check [the new Web Extension](https://github.com/binfalse/YOURLS-FirefoxExtension/tree/master/webextension) for the latest version of the add-on.

This is an extension for Mozilla Firefox to interact with the open source [URL shortener Yourls](http://yourls.org/).

This page is just a stub and just contains a few screenshots. You will find [more information on the plugin's website](https://binfalse.de/software/browser-extensions/yourls-firefox-extension/).
